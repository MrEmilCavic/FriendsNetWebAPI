# ASP.NET Core Web API
A simple API/Back-End to connect the React based Front-End with the MS SQL database.

## Features so far
- Generic Models and Controllers that will be used for future features (Events/Interests) 
- Sign Up/Sign In, incl. password hashing with salts and issuing token
- Creates an empty profile after sign up

## Next steps
In tandem with the Front-End features (at friendsnet repo) growing I will add/adjust the Back-End components on the ASP.NET side.
Up next:
- Editing profile info (+ search params like interests)
- Creating and editing events
